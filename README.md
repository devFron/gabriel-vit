## History
This project already has a version which I have decided to abandon because personally the structure of folders and branches of the project were beginning to become very complex and not very sustainable.
so I have decided to start a new one which will begin a series of [objectives](#objectives) which I have decided to be like this in order to strengthen my skills as a web developer

## Objectives

There will be a section called skills which will contain cards with the preview of a skill which will be obtained from [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) each skill will have a determined time for the moment the skills that are crossed out as NEWBIE and JUNIOR
They will have a period of 24 hours and the ADVANCED and INTERMEDIATE a period of 60 hours
the first skill will start on 11/24/20201 at (8:00 am)
and will end on 01/01/2022 at (12:00 pm)
